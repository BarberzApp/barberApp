  - Stripe account connection validation

### 2. Improved User Experience
- **Progress tracking**: Visual progress bar showing completion percentage
- **Step indicators**: Icons and clear labels for each step
- **Loading states**: Spinner animations during async operations
- **Better placeholders**: Helpful placeholder text for all input fields
- **Clear error messages**: Specific error messages for each validation failure
- **Success feedback**: Toast notifications for successful operations

### 3. Enhanced Error Handling

- **Validation state**: Separate state for validation errors
- **Loading states**: Proper loading state management

### 3. Error Boundaries
- **Try-catch blocks**: Comprehensive error handling throughout
- **Error logging**: Proper error logging for debugging
- **User-friendly errors**: Errors translated to user-friendly messages

### 4. Performance Optimizations
- **Efficient re-renders**: Minimal re-renders through proper state management
- **Lazy loading**: Data loaded only when needed
- **Optimistic updates**: Immediate UI feedback for better perceived performance

## Validation Rules

## Error Handling

### Database Errors
- Graceful handling of missing records
- Proper error messages for constraint violations
- Retry mechanisms for transient errors

### Network Errors
- Timeout handling for API calls
- Retry logic for failed requests
- User-friendly error messages

### Stripe Errors
- Specific error messages for different Stripe error types
- Proper handling of account verification delays
- Clear guidance for users on next steps

## User Flow Improvements

### 1. Progressive Disclosure
- Information is revealed step by step
- Users can't proceed without completing required fields
- Clear indication of what's required vs optional

### 2. Save Progress
- Data is saved after each step
- Users can return to previous steps
- No data loss during the process

### 3. Clear Navigation
- Previous/Next buttons with proper states
- Disabled states when actions aren't available
- Clear indication of current step

### 4. Completion Criteria
- Clear requirements for each step
- Visual feedback on completion status
- Proper redirection after completion

## Future Enhancements

### 1. Additional Validation
- Address verification using external APIs
