## Super Admin Panel

The app includes a super admin panel for managing developer accounts. Only the specified super admin can access this panel.

### Accessing the Super Admin Panel

1. Navigate to `/super-admin` in your browser
2. Login with the super admin credentials:
   - **Email:** primbocm@gmail.com
   - **Password:** Yasaddybocm123!

### Features

- **View All Barbers:** See a list of all registered barbers with their details
- **Search Barbers:** Search by name, business name, or email
- **Toggle Developer Status:** Enable/disable developer mode for any barber
- **Statistics:** View total barbers, developers, and regular barbers count

### Developer Mode

When a barber has developer mode enabled:
- They bypass all Stripe platform fees ($3.38)
- They receive 100% of the service price
- This is intended for development and testing purposes only

### Setting Up Super Admin

To create the super admin account, run:

```bash
node scripts/create-super-admin.js
```

This script will:
- Create the super admin user account if it doesn't exist
- Set the correct password
- Create the necessary profile record

## 📣 Prominent Booking Link for Barbers

Barbers now see a highly visible, easy-to-share booking link banner at the top of their dashboard and settings. This link is the main way for clients to book appointments. Barbers are encouraged to copy, share, or download a QR code for their booking link and send it to clients via text, social media, or in person.

**How it works:**
- The booking link is always visible at the top of the dashboard and settings.
- Barbers can copy the link, share it using their device's share menu, or download a QR code for print or digital sharing.
- This feature is designed to maximize bookings and make it easy for barbers to grow their business.

**Why this matters:**
- The booking link is the main entry point for new clients.
- Making it prominent ensures every barber knows to share it as much as possible.
- More shared links = more bookings!
